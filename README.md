## Netflix Data Analysis Project
 Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset, which contains metadata about titles available on Netflix as of the last update. The goal is to explore patterns, trends, and insights that can help understand Netflix's content distribution across genres, countries, time, and more.
The analysis is structured into multiple phases: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, validation and conclusion  based on insights.

ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
We used Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to generate visual insights:

Bar charts for type distribution

Line plots for content growth over the years

Word clouds for genre and actor frequency

Heatmaps for correlation between content attributes

Pie charts showing rating and country proportions

These visuals make it easier to interpret large volumes of data at a glance.
